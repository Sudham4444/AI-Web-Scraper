# AI-Web-Scraper
An AI web scraper using ollama, brightdata, selenium and other libraries.

## Overview
The AI Web Scraper is a Python-based project that combines the power of web scraping and artificial intelligence to extract and parse content from websites. Using Streamlit for an interactive user interface and Selenium for web scraping, this project is designed to navigate various challenges such as captchas and IP bans. Additionally, it utilizes Ollama, a large language model, for cleaning and parsing the scraped content.

Below is a snapshot of the project interface:

## Features
- Streamlit UI: A user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the web scraper.
- Web Scraping with Selenium: Efficiently navigate and extract data from dynamic websites.
- Captcha and IP Ban Bypass Techniques: Strategies to handle common scraping obstacles.
- Content Cleaning and Parsing with Ollama: Leverage AI for advanced content manipulation.

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into:

- Web Scraping Techniques: Understanding how to use Selenium to interact with and extract data from dynamic websites.
- Handling Common Challenges: Learning how to effectively deal with captchas, IP bans, and other obstacles that may arise during web scraping.
- Data Cleaning and Parsing: Utilizing Ollama for parsing the scraped content, which enhanced my understanding of working with large language models.
- Building Interactive Applications: Gaining experience in creating a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, making the web scraping process more accessible and efficient.
